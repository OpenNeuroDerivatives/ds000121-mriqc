    "TaskDescription": "On each AS trial, subjects were initially presented with one of two incentive-indicating cues (1.5 s). A ring of green dollar bill signs ($), each subtending approximately 1 degree of visual angle, surrounding a central white fixation cross indicated that the subject would win money if they correctly performed the forthcoming trial. An equivalently sized, isoluminant ring of blue pound signs (#) indicated that no money was at stake on that trial. Subjects were not told exactly how much money could be earned on each trial to prevent their keeping a running tally of their performance and engaging working memory systems. However, subjects were told prior to the task that they could win up to an additional $25 contingent on their performance and that no debt would be accrued (i.e., subjects could not owe money). Next, the incentive ring disappeared, and the central fixation cross changed from white to red (1.5 s), indicating to the subject that they should begin to prepare to inhibit a response. Finally, a peripheral stimulus (yellow dot) appeared (75 m) at an unpredictable horizontal location (+/-3 degrees, 6 degrees, and 9 degrees visual angle). Subjects were instructed not to look at the stimulus when it appeared but instead direct their eyes to the mirror location during this time (1475 ms).",
